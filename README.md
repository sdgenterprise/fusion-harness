**Fuse 2–5 frontier models instead of racing them. AND, not OR.**

A composable Pi extension with one configured ARCHITECT, one primary/Main BUILDER (the raw-chat host), and up to three secondary builders. It provides N-way opinions, fusion, debate, coordinated implementation, direct one-agent routing, model selection, and gate-first validation without taking over Pi's footer.

## Install

### Agentic Install

```bash
# in Claude Code, Pi, or your favorite agentic coding tool
/install
```

The `/install` command lives at `.claude/commands/install.md` and handles toolchain checks, Node deps, `.env` verification, and a live launch check.

### Manual Install

**Prereqs:** [`pi`](https://pi.dev/), [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), [`bun`](https://bun.sh), `jq`, [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent   # the pi coding agent
brew install just jq uv                          # command runner + gate tooling
npm install                                      # repo deps (yaml parser)
cp .env.example .env                             # then fill ANTHROPIC/GEMINI/FIREWORKS/OPENAI/OPENROUTER_API_KEY
npm test                                         # 34 deterministic tests, zero paid calls
```

Note: pi reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` for the google provider (not `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`).

## Why fusion

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-12-fusion-fanout-merge-animated.svg" alt="One prompt fans out to every configured model; one sole-writer FUSION agent merges; every model ACKs the result" width="750">
</p>


Model rankings flip every month. Betting a workflow on ONE frontier model means re-betting every month. This harness makes the bet unnecessary: run 2 to 5 models against the same problem, compare or fuse their answers, and keep one shared working directory safe with a single-writer invariant the whole time.

> *The most flexible system wins. AND, not OR.*

## Launch

The fusion stack (Fable 5 architect + Gemini 3.7 Flash Main + DeepSeek V4 Pro):

```bash
just fusion
```

Explicit model stack:

```bash
just fh-stack .pi/fusion-harness/model-stack-trio.yaml
```

Legacy two-slot mode remains compatible:

```bash
just fh-workhorse   # cheap pair · just fh-sota for the frontier pair
```

The extension selects the configured primary builder as Pi's live host model. Invalid/unavailable stacks fail startup.

## Model stack configuration

`--fh-config <path>` accepts an explicit YAML list with 2–5 slots:

```yaml
- name: fable
  model: anthropic/claude-fable-5
  thinking: xhigh
  architect: true
  color: "#A78BFA"

- name: sol
  model: openai/gpt-5.6-sol
  thinking: xhigh
  primary: true
  color: "#F59E0B"

- name: terra
  model: openai/gpt-5.6-terra
  thinking: medium
  color: "#22D3EE"
```

Rules:

- 2–5 slots.
- Exactly one `architect: true`.
- Exactly one **non-architect** `primary: true`; `primary` is only for the Main builder.
- Unique 1–16 character names (`A-Za-z0-9_-`).
- Fully qualified `provider/id` models with configured authentication and visibility in clean-room children launched with `--no-extensions`. Models registered only by another extension are rejected.
- Thinking: `off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max` (short aliases accepted).
- Colors are actual quoted `#RRGGBB` values. Omitted colors use a stable per-stack hash.
- `system_prompt` may be inline or a path relative to the YAML file (full override of pi's default).
- `append_system_prompt` takes one entry or a list — each inline text or a YAML-relative file path — appended in order AFTER the slot's base prompt (the `system_prompt` override, or pi's own default when unset; harness contract prompts come before user appends). Children receive them via pi's repeatable `--append-system-prompt`, so the default prompt is never rebuilt. `/fh-system-prompt` shows the effective result.
- `--fh-config` cannot be mixed with legacy architect/builder model, thinking, or system-prompt flags.

No config auto-discovery occurs; `--fh-config` is explicit.

## Commands

| Command | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/fh [on\|off]` | Command index plus opt-in one-row-per-slot model bar (a `belowEditor` widget). The harness removes Pi's default footer at startup and runs footerless until the bar is toggled on. |
| `/fh-opinion <prompt>` | Every configured model answers independently with strict read-only tools. |
| `/fh-fusion "<prompt>" "<instruction>"` | Every slot researches read-only; one fresh temporary FUSION agent is the sole CWD writer; then the complete fused result is synchronized to every model with exact ACK evidence. |
| `/fh-debate [--rounds N] <prompt>` | N-way read-only debate. Each round every surviving agent receives every other agent's clearly labeled prior opinion, may pick/change sides, and closes without a judge. |
| `/fh-collaborate <prompt>` | Every agent plans read-only, the architect merges the plans into one validated delegation DAG, then tasks execute the moment their dependencies clear — parallel where the DAG allows, sequential paths where it doesn't, exactly one shared-CWD writer at a time — closed by a final architect integration turn. Proposals, the task breakdown, and every task report render as panels; a live task board runs below the editor. |
| `/fh-only [slot] [prompt]` | Address one slot directly. Without a prompt it arms the next plain input as a one-send route; selecting the armed slot again disarms it. |
| `/fh-model` | Three-step picker: slot → model → thinking. Session-only; never rewrites YAML. Main applies both `pi.setModel()` and `pi.setThinkingLevel()` to raw chat. |
| `/fh-auto-validate <prompt>` | Existing gate-first ARCHITECT + Main build loop. |
| `/fh-system-prompt` | Responsive grid of every slot's effective system prompt. |
| `/fh-reset` | Full reset: fresh host session and fresh slot sessions — equivalent to `/new` plus a slot wipe. |

## Single-writer invariant

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-11-collaborate-dag-writer-animated.svg" alt="The writer token hops task to task — reads overlap, exactly one write-enabled child at a time" width="750">
</p>

Agents must never overwrite each other's work.

- `/fh-opinion` and `/fh-debate`: all agents are read-only (`read,grep,find,ls`).
- `/fh-fusion`: all source workers are read-only. Their answers are captured under the run's `/tmp/fusion-harness-*` directory. Only the temporary FUSION agent gets full tools and may modify the CWD.
- `/fh-collaborate`: planning and delegation are tool-enforced read-only; the harness persists the architect's plan JSON. Execution is dependency-driven — read tasks overlap freely, but every write-enabled task waits for the single global writer token, so `maxConcurrentWriteEnabledChildren` is always 1. Worktree commands are observed and fail the run.
- `/fh-only` and `/fh-auto-validate` have one active writer by design.

A CWD-scoped atomic writer lease prevents separate harness processes from mutating the same checkout simultaneously. Child agents run in their own process groups so Escape, timeout, or session shutdown reaches Pi plus tool/bash descendants. Tool allowlists enforce planning safety; prompt contracts also prohibit detached background jobs.

## N-way debate

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-08-debate-rounds-animated.svg" alt="/fh-debate — opening, all-to-all rebuttal, and closing rounds across three colored slots" width="750">
</p>

Round 1 captures independent, falsifiable opening opinions. Before each later round, every agent receives a block for every other agent:

```text
## [SLOT_NAME] provider/model — CONCRETE OPINION
<complete prior-round opinion>
```

Agents are explicitly allowed to defend a side, join another side, synthesize compatible positions, form coalitions, or remain a minority—provided they identify what evidence moved them. Failed agents are labeled and removed from later rounds; the debate continues while at least two opinions survive. All closing opinions render in the responsive AgentGrid. There is no judge or hidden merge.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-09-debate-converge-animated.svg" alt="Positions may converge, form coalitions, or hold as a minority — the user judges" width="750">
</p>

## Collaboration: plan, delegate, execute in parallel

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-10-collaborate-phases-animated.svg" alt="/fh-collaborate — parallel proposals, architect delegation DAG, dependency-ordered execution, final coordination" width="750">
</p>


`/fh-collaborate` has no fixed choreography. Every agent plans the work independently (read-only, in parallel), the ARCHITECT merges those proposals into one validated delegation DAG, and the executor runs on dependency readiness: a task starts the moment its dependencies finish. Independent tasks overlap, dependent tasks form sequential paths, and a slot may own several tasks (they run one at a time on its session).

Everything renders as it happens: proposals as an opinion-style grid panel, the plan as a task table with parallelism levels, every finished task as its own report panel, plus a live task board below the editor (`● writing / ◌ queued / ○ blocked / ✓ done`). The run closes with one final architect integration turn.


## Fusion context synchronization

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-13-fusion-pipeline-animated.svg" alt="/fh-fusion pipeline — fan out, propose, one-writer merge, sync, exact ACKs" width="750">
</p>

After the sole-writer FUSION agent finishes:

1. The exact result is saved to `fused.md` and `fusion-context.md`.
2. The fused panel enters the Main host context. Results above the panel limit are split into one visible head plus complete hidden continuation messages, so raw Main retains every byte.
3. Every slot receives the complete result in a no-tools turn.
4. Each must reply exactly `ACK FUSION <run-id>`; malformed ACKs retry once.
5. `acks/<slot>.md` and `summary.json` record status plus the common SHA-256 hash.
6. The fused result remains visible if ACKs fail, but the run is marked context-sync incomplete.

## Gate-first auto-validation

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/svg-05-gate-first-loop-animated.svg" alt="/fh-auto-validate — the VALIDATOR writes the acceptance gate before the builder does any work" width="750">
</p>


`/fh-auto-validate` inverts the usual order: the VALIDATOR writes a `uv` acceptance gate to disk BEFORE any building happens, a baseline run proves the gate starts red, then Main builds until the gate passes (default cap 5 validations). Failures feed back verbatim; from the third failure the validator adds a read-only triage brief, with a one-shot gate repair if the gate itself is the defect.


## Sessions and UI

- Sessions are keyed by slot plus a hash of the complete `provider/model` and live under a per-process run dir, so concurrent harness launches and model swaps can never share or replay each other's transcripts.
- Main forks the host session; architect and secondary builders keep one session per slot for the LIFETIME OF THE APP RUN — context carries across commands within a launch, and quitting pi discards every slot brain (a restart never resumes old transcripts). `/fh-reset` and `/new` reset mid-run.
- `/fh-model` non-Main model switches mint/resume the correct model-specific session. Main deliberately follows native Pi switching and preserves the existing host transcript across model changes.
- The responsive AgentGrid renders 1–5 columns when each can remain at least 34 cells wide; otherwise agents stack vertically.
- Pi's default footer is removed at TUI startup; the session runs footerless. The opt-in model bar renders one full-width row per slot in its configured hex color when you want status back — each row shows speed, cost, and context together: `◆ ARCHITECT | fable | model (med) | [██--------] 12% | 87 tps | $0.0123`.
- TPS is observed provider-response throughput (output tokens ÷ provider-response seconds; child startup/network/thinking included, tool execution excluded) and is throughput-weighted per slot across the session, folding the in-flight run live. The host's own raw-chat turns are measured at the `before_provider_request → message_end` boundary and credited to the Main row. Live widget columns and final panel stat lines carry the same `N tps` readout per agent.

## Recipes

```bash
just                  # list every recipe
just fh-stack <yaml>  # any explicit 2-5 slot stack
just fusion           # rune (Fable 5 architect) + flux (Gemini Flash Main) + drift (DeepSeek V4 Pro)
just fusion5          # fusion trio + fire (Kimi K3) + hawk (DeepSeek V4 Flash)
just fh-workhorse     # legacy two-slot pair (cheap)
just fh-sota          # legacy two-slot pair (frontier)
```

Stack YAMLs live in `.pi/fusion-harness/` (and `~/.pi/fusion-harness/` for launching from anywhere). A clean demo workspace with the same recipes, scraped DuckDB v2.0 docs in `ai_docs/`, and self-contained demo prompts lives at [`../fusion-harness-v2-playground`](../fusion-harness-v2-playground).

## jev — cheap typed decisions inside the stack

`extensions/jev/jev.ts` puts [Jev](https://github.com/disler/ten-levels-of-jev) (TypeSafe's System One decision model: JSON state in, typed `noul`/`choice`/`score` answers with probabilities out, ~300 ms, fractions of a cent) between the harness and self-compact. It is loaded by the `*-compact` recipes, between fusion-harness and self-compact:

```bash
just direct-compact   # or: fusion-compact / fh-stack-compact <stack.yaml>
```

Three features, each disableable with `--jev-guard=off`, `--jev-reads=off`, `--jev-timing=off` (`--jev=off` for all):

- **Guardrails** — a `tool_call` gate asks Jev what every bash command does (read-only / reversible / irreversible + destructive intent) and blocks with a final, no-workaround notice; write/edit content is screened for real credentials; read/bash output is screened for injected instructions and bannered as data.
- **Cheap reads** — `ask_jev_file_bool` / `ask_jev_file_choice` / `ask_jev_file_score` tools answer a judgment ABOUT a file without the file ever entering the host's context (which also means fewer self-compact cycles on a 1M-window host).
- **Compaction timing** — inside self-compact's warning band, four Jev questions per turn judge checkpoint quality (task switch / clean boundary / mid-operation / history needed); a clean checkpoint surfaces a transient `[jev · checkpoint]` advisory naming `self_compact`, and at compaction one Jev choice picks which turn the live work starts from and folds it into the summary instructions.

Every hook fails open (a Jev outage never blocks the session), guards never run past self-compact's forced line (its lock owns that state), and fusion's clean-room children never see Jev. `/jev` shows calls, estimated cost, blocks, and advisories. Uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; `--jev-backend mock` runs everything offline with safe canned answers.
